# Router

# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.

# Logger

# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),

# Root logger:
# logger.root=ERROR
# logger.root=INFO
# logger.root=DEBUG
# logger.log4j.semlogs=DEBUG
# logger.semlogs=DEBUG

# Logger used by the framework:
# logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
# logger.application=DEBUG
