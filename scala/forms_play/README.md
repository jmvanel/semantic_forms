# Introduction
Here is a web application with Play! framework around the [form generator](../forms/README.md) that does:
- navigation on the LOD (Linked Open Data) cloud,
- CRUD (CReate, Update, Delete) editing,
- search
- semantic cache

For now, the display looks like this, 
plus a textbox to enter a URL semantics, eg a FOAF profile or DBpedia URI : 
[example.form.foaf.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/example.form.foaf.html)

This README is a guide for building and working from source code.
For other documentations, see:

- the [wiki](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki) for User manual and Developer manuals (application and core).
- [Installation of the `semantic_forms` generic application](../../doc/en/install.md) from zip distribution (easy and no compilation)
- [administrator Manual](../../doc/en/administration.md)


## Terminology

Some people speak of "triple store", or "graph database", or "triple database", or "SPARQL database". We will write here just "database".

# How to run
## Run locally from sources

- install dependencies:
  - Java 8 (**Java 9 is not yet ready** for Scala),
  - [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (a build tool like Maven or npm) or [Typesafe Activator](http://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted) .
```shell
SBT_VERSION=0.13.16
wget https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/native-packages/sbt/$SBT_VERSION/sbt-$SBT_VERSION.tgz
tar xvzf sbt-$SBT_VERSION.tgz
# or use Linux package manager if you prefer:
sudo apt-get install sbt
```
Then SBT will download the libraries and dependencies.

- download the source from [Banana-RDf fork on github](https://github.com/deductions/banana-rdf) (temporary, until my Pull Request in Banana-RDF is accepted)
  - build this project with SBT : change directory to `banana-rdf` ;
- start sbt from the shell
- type in the SBT console :
```
       publishLocal
```
- download the source from [semantic\_forms on github](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/)
- build and run the `semantic_forms` project itself with SBT:
  - change directory to `scala/` within the source downloaded from github;
  - type in the SBT console :
```
run
```
NOTE: we moved to Multi-project build in SBT on 20167-03-18 . The common settings are in
scala/project/Common.scala .

The default port is 9000, so you can direct your browser to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) .
To run on another port than 9000 :

    run 9053

To use HTTPS, specify the port like this (see https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ConfiguringHttps )

    run -Dhttps.port=9143 -Dhttp.port=9000

To raise the memory, set this environment variable:

    export SBT_OPTS="-Xmx2G"

To load some common vocabularies (FOAF, ...) and form specifications, see below "Preloading RDF content".
To understand usage of the user interface, see the [User manual wiki](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki).

To build the ScalaDoc, run `sbt doc` , and the ScalaDoc will be in

	target/scala-2.11/api/

A convenience link to [local semantic\_forms ScalaDoc](../forms/target/scala-2.11/api/index.html)


Some references on ScalaDoc: http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/scaladoc.html , http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/scaladoc/for-library-authors.html , http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15394322/how-to-disambiguate-links-to-methods-in-scaladoc

### Other developer's tasks
Checking dependencies
```
project forms
dependencyUpdates
```

## Run without development environment
There are several use cases:

- server (internet or intranet)
- personal usage
- running some memory intensive scripts (avoids the big overhead of SBT)

For both usages, the install is the same (and very easy).
See the [installation doc.](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/doc/en/install.md#installation-of-the-semantic_forms-generic-application)

The personal usage can be a contact manager, project manager, blog, or notes manager, ... It allows to create one's FOAF profile, navigate on the Web of Data and keeping track, or any structured data management. See details on 
 [User manual / possible usages](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki/User_manual#possible-usages)

### Obtaining the zipped application
The zipped application is available as a [github release](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/releases).

Otherwise, to obtain the zipped application when starting from the sources (see above), type in SBT : `dist`

Then the archive is found here :
`target/universal/semantic_forms_play-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip`

### Runnning the zipped application
For more details, , see: [installation doc.](../../doc/en/install.md)

Download this zip on the server, unzip and type:
```shell
cd semantic_forms_play-1.0-SNAPSHOT
nohup bin/semantic_forms_play -J-Xmx50M &
```

By doing this you start a web serveur on your machine. The default port is 9000, so you can direct your browser to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) .

The generic application is perfectly usable out of the box for navigating, see [User manual](https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/wiki/User_manual). However, for editing data, it is better to preload common RDF vocabularies and related form specifications and I18N translations, see:
[installation doc.](../../doc/en/install.md)
and [preloading-rdf-content](#preloading-rdf-content) .

To check that the external service dbpedia-lookup is working
http://rubenverborgh.github.io/dbpedia-lookup-page/

#### Settings when runnning the zipped distribution
For more details, , see: [installation documentation](../../doc/en/install.md)
and [administration documentation](../../doc/en/administration.md).
You can change the default port (9000) to e.g. 9999 like this:

	nohup bin/semantic_forms_play -J-Xmx50M -Dhttp.port=9999 &

There is no need to be administrator.


# Setting a IDE project ( eclipse ...)

Please read explanations on the Banana-RDF project:
[ide-setup](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf/#ide-setup)

Note that you run
```
sbt eclipse
```
just once in the directory scala/forms\_play/ ; this creates configuration for 2 eclipse projects: one in directory forms\_play/, one in directory forms.

You may have to set by hand the dependency in project forms\_play/ towards the other. For this, go in Properties of project, Java Build Path, Projects tab, and Add...

You may have to set by hand the dependency towards the Scala and Java code generated by Play: set this as source folder:

    target/scala-2.11/routes/main/
    target/scala-2.11/twirl/main/

## Ensime

Here are commands I used for installing Ensime for Vim
https://github.com/ensime/ensime-vim

```shell
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install websocket-client
export BROWSER=firefox
echo 'export BROWSER=firefox' >> ~/.bashrc 
mkdir -p ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/
echo 'addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt" % "0.3.3")'     >> ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
sbt gen-ensime
```

## Troubleshooting & tips

- FAILED DOWNLOADS messages for the first SBT build: retry later. With SBT, as with all these dependency managers ( Maven, NMP), given the large amount of downloading from multiple sources, it is often the case that the first time, not everything is there.
- in case of troubles in build, delete `target/` directory
- create eclipse configurations with the "eclipse" command in sbt, in the project directory scala/forms\_play/ :

```
    eclipse with-source=true
```
- in case of strange errors like "JenaTransactionException: end() called for WRITE transaction without commit or abort having been called." , or others, be sure to clean all in sbt:
```
project scala
clean
```

- to remove the red errors in eclipse in Play! project, apply this workaround: http://stackoverflow.com/posts/28551583/revisions

Useful SBT plugins you may install for developppement purposes (add in ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt ):

	addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt" % "1.9.0")
	addSbtPlugin("net.virtual-void" % "sbt-dependency-graph" % "0.8.2")
	addSbtPlugin("com.timushev.sbt" % "sbt-updates" % "0.3.0")

Commands to run with these useful plugins:

	dependencyUpdates
	dependencyTree
	test:dependencyGraph

See: https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph , https://github.com/rtimush/sbt-updates

The jconsole command in the Java JDK is useful to monitor a running application like semantic\_forms, through SBT or standalone.
See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html

## Debug
See [playframework documentation/2.4.x/IDE](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/IDE)

Start SBT like below; then type run. Then start a remote debug in eclipse or another IDE with port 9999.
```shell
export SBT_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=9999" && sbt
```

If the application is non responsive, then do this to get a stack dump of all the threads:
```shell
kill -3 `cat RUNNING_PID`
```
 
## Test

### Unit tests
```shell
cd scala/forms
sbt test
```

### Testing web services
```shell
 wget --method=OPTIONS --save-headers http://localhost:9000/bla

 # Do this (just once) to test URL that are protected by login:
 wget --keep-session-cookies --save-cookies cookies.txt \
    --post-data 'userid=foo&password=bar' \
    -p http://localhost:9000/authenticate

# If the user is not already created:
 wget --keep-session-cookies --save-cookies cookies.txt \
    --post-data 'userid=foo&password=bar&confirmPassword=bar' \
    -p http://localhost:9000/register

# test SPARQL CONSTRUCT service
wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
    --header "Accept: application/ld+json" \
    'http://localhost:9000/sparql?query=CONSTRUCT{?S ?P ?O} WHERE{ GRAPH ?G {?S ?P ?O}} LIMIT 10'
```

The typical content of a cookie file is:
```
# HTTP cookie file.
# Generated by Wget on 2016-12-02 09:02:22.
# Edit at your own risk.

localhost:9000  FALSE   /       FALSE   0       PLAY_SESSION    f80b8a633c4debe1871ca7f23195b9766414fb79-username=foo
```

Another example: HTTP POST on service /update
```shell
cat << DDDD > big-query.rq
update=INSERT { <a:a> <a:a> <a:a>} WHERE { GRAPH ?G { [] ?PROP [] . } }
DDDD
wget  --load-cookies cookies.txt \
--post-file=big-query.rq http://localhost:9000/update
```

## Profiling with JMC

Start SF normally, from SBT or from the zip distribution.

```shell
$ jcmd
6288 sun.tools.jcmd.JCmd
6200 play.core.server.ProdServerStart

$ jcmd 6200 VM.unlock_commercial_features
6200:
Commercial Features now unlocked.
$ jcmd 6200 JFR.start name=my_recording filename=semantic_forms_recording.jfr dumponexit=true
6200:
Started recording 1. No limit (duration/maxsize/maxage) in use.

Use JFR.dump name=my_recording to copy recording data to file.
```
Then stop SF, and load `semantic_forms_recording.jfr` into jmc GUI .

Link: https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-5/jfr-runtime-guide/run.htm#JFRRT172

### Testing web application with Selenium

Alas Selenium IDE, the plugin for Firefox, is discontinued.
We will rework the tests on one of the Scala web test frameworks.

Selenium tests are in `scala/web_tests` .
One must run `scripts/populateRDFCache.sh` before these tests.

# Administration of a server instance from the sources

There is a script that updates the server from the sources, and more: it stops the server, updates the application from sources, and restarts the server :
`./scripts/update_server.sh`

It is advised to deactivate the automatic formatting on a server machine. Just comment out the line `scalariformSettings` in 
scala/forms/build.sbt . 

If you want to change the HTTP ports, etc, look in the Play! documentation:
https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ProductionConfiguration

## Change the log settings

The aplication `semantic_forms` uses Log4J 2 for logging. By default it prints very little.
If you want to apply your log settings, copy one the configuration files in conf/ (or use one as is):
```shell
cp conf/log4j2.debug.properties myconf.properties
vi myconf.properties
nohup bin/semantic_forms_play -Dlog4j.configurationFile=myconf.properties -mem 50 &
```

And with SBT configuring maximum logging is like this
```shell
cd $HOME/src/semantic_forms/scala
sbt -Dlog4j.configurationFile=forms_play/conf/log4j2.debug.properties
```
About the Log4j syntax , see [Log4j manual/configuration.html#Properties](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#Properties)
If no "log4j.configurationFile" system property is given, SF should use the default one log4j2.properties in the classpath ( same content as log4j2.warn.properties ) ; see [Log4j manual/configuration.html#AutomaticConfiguration](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#AutomaticConfiguration) about how Log4j detects congiguration.

## Download Java on a headless server
To download Java from the server with no browser (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10268583/downloading-java-jdk-on-linux-via-wget-is-shown-license-page-instead):

    VERSION=51
    wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" \
    http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u$VERSION-b16/jdk-8u$VERSION-linux-arm-vfp-hflt.tar.gz

or for Linux x86:

    wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" \
    http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u91-b14/jdk-8u91-linux-x64.tar.gz

    wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" \
    http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u91-b14/jdk-8u91-linux-i586.tar.gz


# Database Administration

See [administration page](../../doc/en/administration.md)


# Vocabulary for forms


Here is the OWL vocabulary for ontolgy aware forms, currently used in this application:
[vocabulary/forms.owl.ttl](../../vocabulary/forms.owl.ttl)

It is useful to have, upstream of the FA (Abstract Form) in defined class FormModule.FormSyntax, an RDF vocabulary for forms.
It is not reusing Fresnel, but it could be aligned to Fresnel is necessary.

See also (in french) :
[doc/fr/formulaires.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/doc/fr/formulaires.html)

# Customize the plain vanilla application

semantic\_forms is really a framework, so it is made to override any feature.

The recommended way is to fork the project on github.
This fork that will never be merged (no Pull Request). It is a way to overcome the fact that there is no way (AFAIK) to redefine elements of a Play! project from an independent project.

To update with respect to semantic\_forms, see:

https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

And we must first do once and for all in every working directory from a git clone:
https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/

	git remote add upstream https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms.git

An exemple of such a project is:
[https://github.com/deductions/semantic\_forms-sharecop](https://github.com/deductions/semantic_forms-sharecop)
