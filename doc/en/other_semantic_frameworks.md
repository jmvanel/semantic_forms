- https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora
- [Corese](http://wimmics.inria.fr/corese) a serious infrastructure project, with SPARQL extensions, from french INRIA research institute. It's not clear what facilities it has for building applications.

# Semi-Open source
- Virtuoso, powers dbpedia.org; semi-SQL and RDF

# Commercial
- Odase, a nice OWL, SWRL and SPARQL based Information System framework developped in Mercury
- http://factforge.net/ , a bit like Virtuoso; it's a mainly a demonstrator of GraphDB, and the source code does not seem available
